## [0.2]
- Allow `Thread` to be forcibly reset to a stopped state.
- Improve the `Table` API, add functions that skip `IntoValue` conversion and
  simplify `Table::next`.
- Support `__newindex`.
- Auto conversion improvements, add a `Variadic` wrapper type to indicate
  variadic multi-values instead of bare arrays.
- Add `Function::compose` and `Function::bind` for easier generic function
  handling from Rust.
- Completely track used memory within interpreter instances. Tracks both
  `gc-arena` allocated `Gc` pointers as well as all normal heap allocations
  using `gc-arena` external allocation tracking.
- `Fuel` system to limit the execution time of Lua code.
- Properly handle `...` in table constructors.
- Implement `table.select('#')`, `table.pack`, and `table.unpack`.
- Fix local function declarations to be visible in their own function body.
- Guard against arbitrary recursion depth of callbacks (only ever a risk for
  Threads calling callbacks on *other* Threads, aka Lua coroutines).
